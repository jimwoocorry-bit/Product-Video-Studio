# Third-Party Notices

Policy baseline: P0 V0.2
Last reviewed: 2026-10-05

This file records third-party code, packages and external runtimes approved for Product Video Studio P0. Approval is default-deny and must match `dependency-allowlist.json`.

## Windows system speech

P1 Final optionally invokes the user's already installed Windows `System.Speech` synthesis engine for offline narration. The application does not distribute Microsoft binaries, voice data, language packs, models or fonts. Host operating-system and installed-voice terms continue to apply; this entry is not a blanket commercial-use clearance for every third-party installed voice. Only enabled installed voices are enumerated, and the caller must explicitly select local narration in post-production settings. Plain text is passed through JSON stdin; SSML, remote lexicons and downloads are not used.

The allowlist retains its legacy `approvedForP0` field name for gate compatibility. This P1-only optional host integration does not alter or rebuild the P0 frozen release artifacts. The external-terms category indicates non-redistributed proprietary host terms, not a remote speech service. Set `PVS_LOCAL_TTS_DISABLED=1` to disable the integration. API source: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.speech.synthesis.speechsynthesizer .

## Bundled npm dependency inventory

The lockfile currently resolves 38 exact npm package versions. Installation is allowed only while `npm run license:gate` passes against the exact lockfile.

## Domestic Jimeng official dreamina CLI

Classification: external runtime, not bundled.
Current environment status: official Dreamina CLI 1.4.18 installed and OAuth-authorized as of 2026-09-27.
Official installer page: https://jimeng.jianying.com/ai-tool/install
Verified executable: `C:\Users\Administrator\bin\dreamina.exe`
Verified SHA-256: `13A817E455179AB994495EEDB875CF845348D05F526B21C2EF207E1FC47F6014`
ProviderIdentity is VERIFIED before submit, with version/help/account capability evidence archived by the application.
Third-party Jimeng/Dreamina reverse-engineered CLIs and MIT wrappers are not approved P0 runtime dependencies or fallbacks.

## Hermes Agent structured AI runtime

Classification: external runtime, not bundled.  
Version reviewed: 0.21.3 (local install reports upstream commit 5dd70d7c).  
Upstream: https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent  
License: MIT, Copyright (c) 2025 Nous Research.  
Purpose: structured JSON generation for Product Truth, Creative, Script and Product Director outputs.  
The project calls the installed `hermes` executable as an external process; Hermes source code and its Python/Node dependency tree are not vendored into Product Video Studio. The runtime must be locally version/source verified before use. License text is archived at `third_party/licenses/hermes-agent-0.21.3-LICENSE`.

## FFmpeg external runtime

Classification: external system runtime, not bundled.  
Current reviewed runtime: FFmpeg 9.0.1 full build on the development machine.  
Upstream: https://ffmpeg.org/  
License reported by the installed build: GPL-3.0-or-later.  
Purpose: concatenate already accepted generated clips into the final MP4. Product Video Studio does not redistribute the FFmpeg binary. The License Gate exception applies only to this explicitly registered non-bundled external runtime; GPL packages or vendored GPL code remain denied.

## Douyin OpenAPI

Classification: external official service, not bundled.  
Official platform: https://open.douyin.com/  
Purpose: OAuth user authorization plus `video.create` upload/create APIs for explicit user-confirmed publishing to Douyin. Client secrets and user access tokens are kept outside project artifacts under `.runtime-secrets/` and are never exported into `project.json`.

## social-auto-upload external publisher runtime

Classification: external local runtime, not bundled into Product Video Studio.
Upstream: https://github.com/dreammis/social-auto-upload
Reviewed upstream baseline: commit `0012d2c355f88f683cc38dde2a2db209e14091bc`; PVS integration branch commit: `217d22c64020db961d0cf8c1a19f91f7a12a3f0b`.
License: MIT, Copyright (c) 2023 dreammis. The reviewed license text is archived at `third_party/licenses/social-auto-upload-MIT-LICENSE`.

Product Video Studio uses a separately maintained PVS integration branch of this runtime only behind the `DOUYIN_BROWSER_AUTOMATION` adapter. The application calls the machine-readable `sau-pvs` bridge as an external process; the Python source tree, Patchright/Playwright browser binaries and Python dependency environment are not copied into or redistributed with Product Video Studio by this integration.

Douyin account cookies are stored only below Product Video Studio's ignored `.runtime-secrets/publishing/social-auto-upload/` runtime directory. They are not written to Prisma, project artifacts, `project.json`, normal application logs or Git. Use of Douyin remains subject to the platform's current account, content and publishing rules.

## Yht20927/douyin-cli external operations runtime

Classification: external local runtime, not bundled into Product Video Studio.
Upstream: https://github.com/Yht20927/douyin-cli
Reviewed upstream baseline: commit `04f0a7695a5db48d9a6d3a89d720697570c4a191`; PVS integration branch commit: `cbadd60fcd234d1059529aa5d54f75dcbadd43d6`.
License: MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 Yht20927. The reviewed license text is archived at `third_party/licenses/yht-douyin-cli-MIT-LICENSE`.

Product Video Studio invokes this separately installed runtime only through the typed Douyin Operations adapter and its machine-readable, read-only `PVS_DOUYIN_JSON` v1 bridge. P0 capabilities are limited to health/identity checks, own-work data, public search, video detail, comments, replies and selected-video media metadata. The runtime's Node source tree, Tampermonkey extension, dedicated browser profile, cookies, bridge token, browser binaries and local SQLite state are not copied into or redistributed with Product Video Studio.

P0 deliberately does not expose the runtime's write-capable comment, like, DM or campaign commands. Login, captcha and risk-control states fail closed and require normal user action. PVS persists its own work bindings, metric history and comments as the business source of truth. Use of Douyin remains subject to the platform's current account, content, publishing and research rules.

## Prohibited license classes

The P0 License Gate rejects GPL, AGPL, SSPL, UNKNOWN, NOASSERTION, unlicensed/no-LICENSE sources and any dependency not explicitly allowlisted. The rule applies to direct dependencies, transitive dependencies, vendored files and copied source. The only GPL exception is the explicitly registered, non-bundled FFmpeg system runtime; no GPL code or binary is distributed with this project.
